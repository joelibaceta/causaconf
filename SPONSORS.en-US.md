# Sponsors

([Versión en español](SPONSORS.md))

**CausaConf is a non-profit conference** organized by a group of several
developer communities under the [Perú Dev](https://peru-dev.org/) initiative.
Organizers and _staff_ are volunteers offering their time and effort without
remuneration.

In order to make the conference real, we need to cover a budget including plane
tickets, accommodation, catering, stickers, badges, domain names, ...

These costs will be covered both by [ticket sales](https://causaconf.pe/#tickets)
and [sponsors](https://causaconf.pe/#sponsors), who help us keep ticket prices
affordable, as well as providing opportunity grants.

If your organization is interested in becoming a sponsor, we ask you to read the
values and principles [shared by the organizing communities](https://peru-dev.org/)
(in spanish :see_no_evil:).
